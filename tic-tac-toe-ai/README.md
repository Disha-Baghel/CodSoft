# TIC TAC TOE AI
### Description
This project is a React-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, enhanced with an intelligent computer player using the Minimax algorithm. The game provides an interactive and responsive user interface, allowing players to face off against a computer opponent that makes strategic moves to challenge the player. With features like game reset and clear winner displays, this project demonstrates the fusion of web development, React state management, and artificial intelligence to create a compelling and enjoyable gaming experience.
